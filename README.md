In this screen the rules are listed and they can start the game or view the high scores. If the user chooses to click the start button, the game will commence. The user will be presented with the first question and a timer of 60 seconds will begin counting down. When the user clicks on a potential answer, the game will tell them if they are right or wrong. If they are wrong they will lose 5 seconds on the timer. Right or wrong, the user will be presented with the next questions and potential asnswers. The game is over when they have answered all of the questions or when the timer reaches 0. The score will be the time remaining when the game is over.
